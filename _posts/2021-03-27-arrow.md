# Introduction

As many other data processing systems, [Arcon](https://github.com/cda-group/arcon) is also betting on the [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) format. 

Arcon has until recently been a pure row-based (Protobuf) system. 
While this format works for a range of streaming operations, it is not a suitable for ad-hoc OLAP queries or larger bulk aggregations on streaming windows. 
With a Columnar format, we gain a lot from vectorised processing (SIMD) and the fact that we can share internal Arcon state with other systems through interfaces such as ``Arrow Flight``.

In this post, I'll go through how Arcon handles the conversion from Protobuf to Arrow data.

## Arcon

Let's first go over the structure of an ``ArconType`` in Arcon. 
Down below you can see its Rust trait. 

```rust
pub trait ArconType: ArconTypeBounds
where
    Self: std::marker::Sized,
{
    #[cfg(feature = "unsafe_flight")]
    /// Serialisation ID for Arcon's Unsafe In-flight serde
    const UNSAFE_SER_ID: SerId;
    /// Serialisation ID for Arcon's Reliable In-flight serde
    const RELIABLE_SER_ID: SerId;
    /// Current version of this ArconType
    const VERSION_ID: VersionId;

    /// Return the key of this ArconType
    fn get_key(&self) -> u64;
}
```
It is in the ``ArconTypeBounds`` trait that we set the requirement that the type must be a Protobuf supported message. This is done through the [prost](https://github.com/danburkert/prost) crate and its ``Message`` trait. More details on the ArconType may be found [here](https://cda-group.github.io/arcon/introduction/data_format.html#arcontype).

To implement an ArconType we use the ``Arcon`` derive macro as seen below.

``` rust
#[arcon::proto]
#[derive(Arcon, Clone)]
#[arcon(unsafe_ser_id = 12, reliable_ser_id = 13, version = 1, keys = "f1")]
pub struct Event {
  pub f1: u64,
  pub f2: String,
  pub f3: f64,
}
```

The above Rust struct is equivalent the following Protobuf message:

``` proto
message Event {
  uint64 f1 = 1;
  string f2 = 2;
  double f3 = 3;
}
```

Right, so at this point we have defined our Protobuf data. Next we'll go through the steps of the Arrow conversion.

## Working with Arrow

Converting the ``Event`` structure to Arrow data is not straightfoward. The Arrow [crate]() provides a bunch of low-level builder types that one can use to build up Arrays of data.
Let's first go through an example of where we build it manually.


```rust
let capacity = 1024;

let mut f1_builder = UInt64Builder::new(capacity);
let mut f2_builder = StringBuilder::new(capacity);
let mut f3_builder = Float64Builder::new(capacity);

f1_builder.append_value(1).unwrap();
f2_builder.append_value(String::from("data")).unwrap();
f3_builder.append_value(10.5).unwrap();

// Build the Arrays
let f1_array = f1_builder.finish();
let f2_array = f2_builder.finish();
let f3_array = f3_builder.finish();

// Define Schema
let schema = Arc::new(Schema::new(vec![
      Field::new("f1", DataType::UInt64, false),
      Field::new("f2", DataType::Utf8, false),
      Field::new("f3", DataType::Float64, false),
]));

// Build up a Arrow RecordBatch using our Arrays and Schema
let batch = RecordBatch::try_new(
    schema.clone(),
    vec![Arc::new(f1_array),
         Arc::new(f2_array),
         Arc::new(f3_array),
    ],
);
```
As you can see, the process of building up columnar data of the ``Event`` struct is a bit of a hassle. In Arcon, we have implemented
an ``Arrow`` derive macro that hides this complexity from the users.
