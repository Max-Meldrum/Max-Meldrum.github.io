  <p>I like building things. I prefer that those things communicate over the wire.</p>

  <p>I am in the final year of the Software Engineering of Distributed Systems master's programme at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 
  Alongside my studies, I am working at the CSL lab (RISE SICS) where I am building the distributed runtime for the ongoing <a href="https://www.sics.se/media/news/continuous-deep-analytics-is-granted-33-million-sek-by-ssf">Continuous Deep Analytics</a> (CDA) project </p>

  
  <p>TLDR: Max -> Distributed systems, UNIX/Linux, and vim.</p>
